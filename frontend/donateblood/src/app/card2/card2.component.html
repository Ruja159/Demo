        Universal donors are those with an O negative blood type. Why? O
        negative blood can be used in transfusions for any blood type. Type O is
        routinely in short supply and in high demand by hospitals â€“ both because
        it is the most common blood type and because type O negative blood is
        the universal blood type needed for emergency transfusions and for
        immune deficient infants. Approximately 45 percent of Caucasians are
        type O (positive or negative), but 51 percent of African-Americans and
        57 percent of Hispanics are type O. Minority and diverse populations,
        therefore, play a critical role in meeting the constant need for blood.
        Types O negative and O positive are in high demand. Only 7% of the
        population are O negative. However, the need for O negative blood is the
        highest because it is used most often during emergencies. The need for
        O+ is high because it is the most frequently occurring blood type (37%
        of the population). The universal red cell donor has Type O negative
        blood. The universal plasma donor has Type AB blood. For more about
        plasma donation, visit the plasma donation facts.
